# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

A movie recommendation system built using **Collaborative Filtering** and **Content-Based Filtering**, powered by **Flask** for a simple web interface. The system uses the popular [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) to provide personalized movie suggestions.

##  Features

-  Recommend movies based on user input
-  Collaborative filtering using matrix factorization (SVD)
-  Content-based filtering using movie metadata
-  Web interface built with Flask
-  Model saved and loaded using `joblib`

##  How It Works

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies based on similar users' preferences using SVD (Singular Value Decomposition).
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Uses movie genres and descriptions to recommend similar movies.
- Combines both for a **hybrid recommendation** experience.
